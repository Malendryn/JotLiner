## Plugin System
Jotliner features a flexible plugin system that allows you to create custom editors, tools, and features as nodes within an infinite canvas—-but with a unique twist: canvases can be nested within or beside each other, creating a multi-level structure without limits. Each plugin is installed separately and provides unique abilities, such as text editors, drawing tools, spreadsheets, Markdown, or anything else a creator can imagine!


Real-Time Sync: Syncs notes and content across all open browsers.
