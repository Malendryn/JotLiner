TODO: make toplevel BOX  'hard-fix-positioned' and unchangable!  (no modding anchors so always TRBL=0px)
    we can just use if (dch == FG.curDoc.rootDch) {then nochange allowed}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO instead of opening a dialog for anchor editing, lets just overwrite the toolbar with the <--> <----> <--> LWR anchors
    and overwrite the <divIndex> with the THB anchors, that'll work nicely as we no longer have to worry about a dlg
    being in-the-way all the time AND gives us plenty of room to add more gadgets in the index area for things like
    'border 1px dashed black; background-color' and stuff like that
        We have 2 dialogs for handling anchors,  both are temps only, index.html:popDlgDCHAnchor and 
        'popDlgDCHAnchor.html in the --deleteme-- dir'..  we are NOT USING the --deleteme-- one and we're 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO see if we can animate selected box so it 'blinks' or fades/phases while editing  (but caution when setting things like
background-color as we cant do that when phasing...!)   so think of a way...

BUG: there is a minor quirk where if you have c+a down, then click+drag, then with c+a STILL down you click+drag a diff
object, its starting x/y is a little off and it 'jumps' a short distance.  I haven't yet found what's causing that
It works fine if you release c+a between moves,  only when you keep c+a down and move 2 or more items
    (Something to do with all the mousemove stuff in fem_core_TKMEvtHandler.js)
