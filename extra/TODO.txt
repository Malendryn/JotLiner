so, in order to support scrollbars, we can't ever go left/top=negative

we wont have to worry about updating the screen when dragging/sizing the rects, but when they release it we have to
push everything to the positive until all negatives are zero

we also want the scrollbars to move with us in such a way the screen doesn't move, making it appear that the screen
grew to the left when in reality everything was shoved to the right

AN ALTERNATIVE is to keep a zTop and zLeft value which is always added to all dch's when drawn.  thereby letting us have
the illusion of negativity, and then we can have a function somewhere that 'shifts' everything to zero zTop and zLeft out again
for this we need to add 2 elements to the docHeader for zLeft and zTop so for example:
    change: @1.0;4dc5b290-2f18-419b-be10-427772d92c70;
    to:     @1.0;4dc5b290-2f18-419b-be10-427772d92c70;-1000;-3000;

the advantage to this approach is that when someone sets a dch's position, it won't move on them

BUG: (?unfixable?) when prog starts, if I ctrl+alt and rightclick in the INDEX frame, I get the 'new document' context menu
but if I close the menu, then re-press ctrl+alt and rightclick, no menu appears.  this is odd.

it also DOESNT happen if I just hit reload, it ONLY happens if I close and start the program anew

    I found the reason is that the divIndexView (in fact the entire program) does not have focus when it starts, therefore
    it's not firing keydown/up events, even though mouse events ARE firing.  it doesnt track these keyboard events until I
    click or right-click on something, and even then the click:evt.keyAlt etc are not valid at this first-time-clicking-event
        I tried document.body.focus() and div=document.getElementById("divDocView");div.focus() but that didnt work either
    This does however explain why it works fine on reload, just not on progstart.  cuz on reload it does indeed have focus
        at start-time
