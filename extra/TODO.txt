when anything exists outside the scrollregion we want to show that edge's border in a diff pattern or color
    (but only when mode1 or 2, not 0)

I think to achieve this we may need to completely rewrite the mask/ghost system specifically for mode2 such that:
mask isnt really needed at all, even in mode 1.

ghosts are needed such that the dragged zX/Y window has one 
every item within that dch needs one even if it's not visible on screen! 
    we want to show ghosts over all the children SO THAT WE CAN SEE the invisible ones OUTSIDE the infinite region!

CAN WE GET RID OF THE MASK! ??
CAN WE GET RID OF THE MASK! ??
CAN WE GET RID OF THE MASK! ??

so for mode 1, it works just fine as is methinks
    * alt+shift shows ghost over any object mouse is over
    * mouseDown lets us drag, and the ghost stays visible even if drag goes outside the dchBox it's inside of
        (the control itself hides cuz its in the box, but the ghost is created at <body> level so it stays visible always!)
    * mode1 DOES NOT allow selecting dchRoot box!

CAN WE GET RID OF THE MASK! ??
mode2:
    * alt+shift+z should immediately ghost over any BOX we're over (if we're over another plugin, parent-walk until BOX)
            this ghost needs to be different color-or-shade than the others too
        * ALSO all children (ALL even if wildly off screen!)  get a ghost of their own, so that when...
    ..mouseDown lets us drag ALL the ghosts (except the one on BOX itself) //as well as// the nodes/plugins just like
        mode1 does, except for all nodes AND ghosts together!

when properties popup for DCH_BOX we want to show 'infinite Pan offset' and let user edit it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add using cmdCombo+arrowkeys to move the boxes one pixel at a time
    problem with this is as I have to remain hovering over the object to move, but that's not really a biggie is it?
        of course if you shift the box away from the mouse you'll have issues...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add a popup for mode2 moving (or at the very least add the values to the titlebar in the __tmpKBModeTitlebar)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRE-GITHUB Todos

* Put better names for dch's to display at the top of the screen (rather than just DCH or TXA etc...)

* add a 'choose db' option and allow them to have multiple db's they can switch easily between  (do this soon to help 
    ME switch quickly to the examples.db etc... and back again!)


1 make docTree dragdrop work properly!  (reordering of doctree documents)
    move docs (dragdrop, in/out depth too)

* front/back depth of dch's within document
* cut/copy/paste dch's (or delete/copy/move wherein copy/move .cursor('x') the mouseIcon til you click to drop)
* dialogs like colorwheel rgba
        we will use Pickr (see TEST_Pickr.html)  but we want a local copy so no src="https://..."
            remember how to handle the MIT licence on it properly!
* add more 'demo' dch's like 
    SSH spreadsheet, 
    IMG pic(gif/jpg/png) although technically CTE does this
    IDEF0 IDEF0 (also named like this to show that names are not restricted to 3 characters!)
    DWG (drawing program)
    CODE codeblock (monospaced, linenumbered)
    MDN Markdown (Github compatible)


__tmpKBModeTitlebar
__tmpKBModeToolbar

don't forget that when we add the Colorpikr to license it appropriately!

when storing docs and indexlist, we need to save the scrollbar and opened-indexes as well
    * the doc scrollbars are systemwide
    * the opened indexes are per-browser

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
* I kinda like the little icon cherrytree puts in front of the index entries, but maybe instead we just make a little box
    that you can set the color of?  or maybe color the entire entry?

* improve contextmenu to allow submenus  (we might use the <ul> system for this, but I like the 'detached' menus like 
    vsCode has that open when you hover)
    (NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM would work for the menu dropdown system too!)

* create menubar (file/edit/help)
    make that allow submenus  (piggyback off contextMenu system)

* ?UNDO?  (possibly not needed as CTE for example already does this)

* we should consider timestamping the ‘send-expect’ed packet in the queue (we do, actually) and maybe once a sec check for ‘dead’ packets (we don't yet)
    maybe even adding a ‘timeoutLength’ option too
    and also a way to cancel-expect so at least on the client side we can say ‘try again’ sooner so we don't end up with two responses

* store dragbar location in userLocalStore
* store which indexEntrys are expanded in userLocalStore

DETAIL: scrollbars: so, in order to support scrollbars, we can't ever go left/top=negative

we now have a special <div> inside the __sysDiv which we can simply reposition based on the zLeft/zTop (or zX zY)
     and we can now use <div>.style.transform = “translateX(-33px)” on this div to move everything at once!

we also want the scrollbars to move with us in such a way the screen doesn't move, making it appear that the screen
grew to the left when in reality everything was shoved to the right

    for this we need to add zX and zY to the BOX import/export (and also scrollX scrollY)
