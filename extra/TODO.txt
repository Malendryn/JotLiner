when anything exists outside the scrollregion we want to show that edge's border in a diff pattern or color
    (but only when mode1 or 2, not 0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we ALSO when in mode2 want to show ghosts over all the children SO THAT WE CAN SEE the invisible ones outside the box!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add using cmdCombo+arrowkeys to move the boxes one pixel at a time
    problem with this is as I have to remain hovering over the object to move, but that's not really a biggie is it?
        of course if you shift the box away from the mouse you'll have issues...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add a popup for mode2 moving (or at the very least add the values to the titlebar in the __tmpKBModeTitlebar)

PRE-GITHUB Todos

(I think I may need to start moving a lot of the internal 'style' ops to external .css files)

1 make docTree dragdrop work properly!  (reordering of doctree documents)
    move docs (dragdrop, in/out depth too)

* scrollbars on DCH_BOXes  (see DETAIL: scrollbars below) particularly as this may change doc1.0 format
* front/back depth of dch's within document
* cut/copy/paste dch's (or delete/copy/move wherein copy/move .cursor('x') the mouseIcon til you click to drop)
* dialogs like colorwheel rgba
        we will use Pickr (see TEST_Pickr.html)  but we want a local copy so no src="https://..."
            remember how to handle the MIT licence on it properly!
* add more 'demo' dch's like 
    SSH spreadsheet, 
    IMG pic(gif/jpg/png) although technically CTE does this
    IDEF0 IDEF0 (also named like this to show that names are not restricted to 3 characters!)
    DWG (drawing program)
    CODE codeblock (monospaced, linenumbered)
    MDN Markdown (Github compatible)


__tmpKBModeTitlebar
__tmpKBModeToolbar
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
don't forget that when we add the Colorpikr to license it appropriately!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when storing docs and indexlist, we need to save the scrollbar and opened-indexes as well
    * the doc scrollbars are systemwide
    * the opened indexes are per-browser

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
* I kinda like the little icon cherrytree puts in front of the index entries, but maybe instead we just make a little box
    that you can set the color of?  or maybe color the entire entry?

* improve contextmenu to allow submenus  (we might use the <ul> system for this, but I like the 'detached' menus like 
    vsCode has that open when you hover)
    (NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM would work for the menu dropdown system too!)

* create menubar (file/edit/help)
    make that allow submenus  (piggyback off contextMenu system)

* ?UNDO?  (possibly not needed as CTE for example already does this)

* we should consider timestamping the ‘send-expect’ed packet in the queue (we do, actually) and maybe once a sec check for ‘dead’ packets (we don't yet)
    maybe even adding a ‘timeoutLength’ option too
    and also a way to cancel-expect so at least on the client side we can say ‘try again’ sooner so we don't end up with two responses

* store dragbar location in userLocalStore
* store which indexEntrys are expanded in userLocalStore

DETAIL: scrollbars: so, in order to support scrollbars, we can't ever go left/top=negative

we now have a special <div> inside the __sysDiv which we can simply reposition based on the zLeft/zTop (or zX zY)
     and we can now use <div>.style.transform = “translateX(-33px)” on this div to move everything at once!

we also want the scrollbars to move with us in such a way the screen doesn't move, making it appear that the screen
grew to the left when in reality everything was shoved to the right

    for this we need to add zX and zY to the BOX import/export (and also scrollX scrollY)
