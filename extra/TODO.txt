I think I may need to start moving a lot of the internal 'style' ops to external .css files

1 make docTree dragdrop work properly!  (reordering of doctree documents)


* scrollbars on DCH_BOXes  (see DETAIL: scrollbars below) particularly as this may change doc1.0 format
* move docs (dragdrop, in/out depth too)
* front/back depth of dch's within document
* cut/copy/paste dch's (or delete/copy/move wherein copy/move .cursor('x') the mouseIcon til you click to drop)
* dch styles (border, background, seethrough,etc)
* dialogs like colorwheel rgba
        we will use Pickr (see TEST_Pickr.html)  but we want a local copy so no src="https://..."
            remember how to handle the MIT licence on it properly!
* add more 'demo' dch's like 
    SSH spreadsheet, 
    IMG pic(gif/jpg/png) although technically CTE does this
    IDEF0 IDEF0 (also named like this to show that names are not restricted to 3 characters!)
    DWG (drawing program)
    CODE codeblock (monospaced, linenumbered)
    MDN Markdown (Github compatible)

don't forget that when we add the Colorpikr to license it appropriately!

TODO
* in the left pane we have <ul> with a single depth of <li>, we really should think about using the builtIn multidepth
    ability of <ul><li><ul...deeper>  autoexpander/shrinker rather than constructing our own using the <div>'s

* I kinda like the little icon cherrytree puts in front of the index entries, but maybe instead we just make a little box
    that you can set the color of?  or maybe color the entire entry?

* improve contextmenu to allow submenus  (we might use the <ul> system for this, but I like the 'detached' menus like 
    vsCode has that open when you hover)
    (NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM would work for the menu dropdown system too!)

* create menubar (file/edit/help)
    make that allow submenus

* ?UNDO?  (possibly not needed as CTE for example already does this)

* we should consider timestamping the ‘send-expect’ed packet in the queue (we do, actually) and maybe once a sec check for ‘dead’ packets (we don't yet)
    maybe even adding a ‘timeoutLength’ option too
    and also a way to cancel-expect so at least on the client side we can say ‘try again’ sooner so we don't end up with two responses

* [potentially] VASTLY improve multiclient update pushes, for example if we tell all clients a new docchange was made and a client fetches
    a new doc because of it,  in the case of a CTE you lose your current cursor position (and focus even!)  

* store dragbar location in table 'extra'

DETAIL: scrollbars: so, in order to support scrollbars, we can't ever go left/top=negative

we wont have to worry about updating the screen when dragging/sizing the rects, but when they release it we have to
push everything to the positive until all negatives are zero

we also want the scrollbars to move with us in such a way the screen doesn't move, making it appear that the screen
grew to the left when in reality everything was shoved to the right

AN ALTERNATIVE is to keep a zTop and zLeft value which is always added to all dch's when drawn.  thereby letting us have
the illusion of negativity, and then we can have a function somewhere that 'shifts' everything to zero zTop and zLeft out again
for this we need to add 2 elements to the docHeader for zLeft and zTop so for example:
    change: @1.0;4dc5b290-2f18-419b-be10-427772d92c70;
    to:     @1.0;4dc5b290-2f18-419b-be10-427772d92c70;-1000;-3000;

the advantage to this approach is that when someone sets a dch's position, it won't move on them
