when anything exists outside the scrollregion we want to show that edge's border in a diff pattern or color
    (but only when mode1 or 2, not 0)

I tried doing this in showGhosts() but there's an anomaly where if you go to mode2 -> mode0 (lift alt/shift before z) 
it doesn't catch it.  ALSO I'd like that red border to stay visible at all times in 'live action' mode such that while
DRAGGING zX/Y it will update the red border instantly!

BUT I would also like to NOT show the red border AT ALL when in mode0! (but ALWAYS in mode1/2 for ALL dch's)

so we could puta toggle in showGhosts()  that checks against FG.ghosts{} for a stateflag? 

like .showOOB that we test if mode=0 and true then clearRED and set false, and vica versa

showOOB:  false,    // if false when mode 0, set true and clear OOB's,  if true when mode NOT0, set false and set OOBs 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when properties popup for DCH_BOX we want to show 'infinite Pan offset' and let user edit it (in the properties popup!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add using cmdCombo+arrowkeys to move the boxes one pixel at a time
    problem with this is as I have to remain hovering over the object to move, but that's not really a biggie is it?
        of course if you shift the box away from the mouse you'll have issues...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NICE TO HAVE if when mode1 we could drag corners of a box that we see the shadow of but the corner we want to drag
is invisible cuz it's outside the frame of the parent BOX

PRE-GITHUB Todos

* Put better names for dch's to display at the top of the screen (rather than just DCH or TXA etc...)

* add a 'choose db' option and allow them to have multiple db's they can switch easily between  (do this soon to help 
    ME switch quickly to the examples.db etc... and back again!)


1 make docTree dragdrop work properly!  (reordering of doctree documents)
    move docs (dragdrop, in/out depth too)

* front/back depth of dch's within document
* cut/copy/paste dch's (or delete/copy/move wherein copy/move .cursor('x') the mouseIcon til you click to drop)
* dialogs like colorwheel rgba
        we will use Pickr (see TEST_Pickr.html)  but we want a local copy so no src="https://..."
            remember how to handle the MIT licence on it properly!
* add more 'demo' dch's like 
    SSH spreadsheet, 
    IMG pic(gif/jpg/png) although technically CTE does this
    IDEF0 IDEF0 (also named like this to show that names are not restricted to 3 characters!)
    DWG (drawing program)
    CODE codeblock (monospaced, linenumbered)
    MDN Markdown (Github compatible)

don't forget that when we add the Colorpikr to license it appropriately!

when storing docs and indexlist, we need to save the scrollbar and opened-indexes as well
    * the doc scrollbars are systemwide
    * the opened indexes are per-browser

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
* I kinda like the little icon cherrytree puts in front of the index entries, but maybe instead we just make a little box
    that you can set the color of?  or maybe color the entire entry?

* improve contextmenu to allow submenus  (we might use the <ul> system for this, but I like the 'detached' menus like 
    vsCode has that open when you hover)
    (NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM would work for the menu dropdown system too!)

* create menubar (file/edit/help)
    make that allow submenus  (piggyback off contextMenu system)

* ?UNDO?  (possibly not needed as CTE for example already does this)

* we should consider timestamping the ‘send-expect’ed packet in the queue (we do, actually) and maybe once a sec check for ‘dead’ packets (we don't yet)
    maybe even adding a ‘timeoutLength’ option too
    and also a way to cancel-expect so at least on the client side we can say ‘try again’ sooner so we don't end up with two responses

* store dragbar location in userLocalStore
* store which indexEntrys are expanded in userLocalStore

DETAIL: scrollbars: so, in order to support scrollbars, we can't ever go left/top=negative

we now have a special <div> inside the __sysDiv which we can simply reposition based on the zLeft/zTop (or zX zY)
     and we can now use <div>.style.transform = “translateX(-33px)” on this div to move everything at once!

we also want the scrollbars to move with us in such a way the screen doesn't move, making it appear that the screen
grew to the left when in reality everything was shoved to the right

    for this we need to add zX and zY to the BOX import/export (and also scrollX scrollY)

TODO: consider requestAnimationFrame()

when dragging DCH_BOX children, the mouse activity is entirely delta-from-prior-movement based, and this can get
glitchy.  The proper way to do it is to track the box's position seperately (for example trap boxData at moment of
mousedown) and delta it from there, calling 'id = requestAnimationFrame()' to do actual boxMovement and scrollboxSizing
(and with the id we can call cancelAnimationFrame() to remove any unprocessed ones off the queue first)

NOTE: I can't know if a returned id actually fired but I can track it myself with an incrementer or a [] of id's, and 
then have the requestAnimationFrame's (callback) delete its own id from the list,  thereby letting me iterate through
the list of uncancelled ones and cancelling them

howabout array.push(requestAnimationFrame(callbacK)) and then in callback delete that id from array cuz its now 
processing, and then also before calling array.push(...) iterate through the array and cancelAnimationFrame() 
on any id's still present (and empty the array too)
