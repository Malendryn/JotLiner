* finished the DocFileFormat 1.1.odt documentation

 2025-05-24 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DCH_BASE .loadCss is now .loadStyle(str) and it now supports a str of "<style>...</style>" or a URL path to a .css file
* DFDialog has also been significantly tweaked to allow styles to be applied in a similar manner as DCH_BASE now does
* DFContextMenu and DFMenuBar now accept the cssList as part of the class constructor, but otherwise operates the 
    same as DFDialog does now.
* further reworking of DFDialog, changed the params to open() to always be a dict.  Just adds much more flexibility!
* doing the same for DFContextMenu and DFMenuBar which adds the bonus of allowing DFMenuBar to pass a different 
    list of stylesheets to DFContextMenu, which it wasn't able to do before
* changed internal version to 1.1 so docImporter can handle a new storage format that now allows for many 'true' datatypes
    to be stored rather than everything-must-be-a-key-value-STRING-pair
* the new JLPAINT plugin is working!   
* in the anchor dialog, min width and height now limited to min=20

2025-05-23------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed compatibility issue between firefox and chrome that was due to the way I was shoehorning <style> into the
    <form> data.  DFDialog now allows "form" -or- {form:"form", style:"style"} as a parameter to pass in a proper
    style block that now gets attached to the head where it belongs. (and removed when dialog closes)
* added quick temporary actions to the Help menu for About and License
* changed 'properties' to 'Layout, anchors and depth' and introduced a new properties menu option which will be a 
    direct call to the dch handlers to create their own properties dialog
* adding a new plugin under JLPAINT as a tiny painting program (primarily for demoing how to create plugins)
* moved .odt and .dia files in /extra to /extra/docs
* added extra/docs/DCHModuleBuilding.ods to document the node creation process (using JLPAINT as an example)
* moved various testing .html files out of /client into /extra/test HTMLs
* fixed a bug in where tooltips werent appearing in context menus
* realized I was missing a few files by accident!  added now

2025-05-23 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* renamed TKMEventHandlers to DocViewHandler -- just makes more sense now that it's evolved
* new child docs will now properly expand the doc they are a child of
* remembering expanded state of index entries is now stored and recalled when starting program or changing dbs
* fixed bug wherein deleting a doc with children stopped warning it would delete them too
* fixed bug in server where inserting new recs wasn't properly returning the new recId

2025-05-22 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* cleaned up and reworded a few more readme's and texts (primarily for github public reading)
* re-introduced autoincrement id fields to the extra and doc tables to prevent future 'shooting myself in the foot'

2025-05-22 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* renamed original CHANGELOG.txt to CHANGELOG-pre_github.txt and started this new file to replace it
* cleaned up and reworded a few of the readme's
