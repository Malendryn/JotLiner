I was going to allow XYWH to let negative WH work from the right border, but OneNote never did that, and I think it just
complicates things,  so we'll stick with XYWH being absolute values
* changed 'isRaw'   to 'hasChunk'
* changed 'hasXYWH' to 'hasDiv'
* I unfortunately finally lost in an attempt to define class functions beneath the class when I tried using super.func()
so I have instead changed these to be simple comments at the top of the class for clarity, while at the bottom of the
class the actual function exists (instead of being defined beneath the class)


loading AND drawing now works!  ... at least in a testing capacity
I have also reintroduced allowing negative WH as I found that by making all divs 'position="absolute"' this now works!
    (I still do not see a need for it in a document like this, but it's nice to know it works!!)

added a VER handler to load a version from the file for the purposes of updating
* changed 'type' to 'hasXYWH' and 'isRaw'

starting to get the visual layout working,  'BOX' now shows a box
next is to get TXT working too

2025-04-03 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that I got the loader working ... I rewrote it again!  NO LONGER uses +=-  just straightup BOX TXT etc objects

have it now loading the sample doc, including stepping in and out of children.
next aim is to display these loaded DocComponents 

2025-04-01 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
began fleshing out classes to load/unload an actual document, and to define the format of a document as well
(I am avoiding using the word Jot or JotLiner anywhere in the code as I still may change the name of the project)

2025-04-01 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
began laying out overall 'frame' of file format
figured out new way to achieve c++-like inheritance without using .prototype
moved all client code one subdir deeper (under html) so that .vscode, .envrc etc arent part of the user content

2025-03-31 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
got all the basics of loading bem_core_<name>.js modules working in both frontend and backend of client
reworked globals and initialization (formerly bootstrap) to be more 'appropriately positioned'?

at any rate the basics on both front and backend are now all set up to work properly once again!

2025-03-30 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
managed to seperate client and server into 2 diff debuggers so I can launch 
    code code.workspace in the server dir and F5 to run and debug that
    --and seperately launch--
    code code.workspace in the client dir and F5 to run and debug that AT the same time


2025-03-28 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
got the most basic stuff working now
got a simple 'client/jotliner.html' setup and debuggable using vscode
got a simple 'server/jlserver.js' setup (as an express server on 8080) and debuggable using vscode

next step is to move the bulk of the functionality out of 'project.jotliner_02' into this project
2025-03-28 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting project anew (again!)
Concept this time is everything runs in a webpage and it talks to an SQL DB on some backend

Notion here is that html already handles all we desire, we just have to figure out how to make it work for us
