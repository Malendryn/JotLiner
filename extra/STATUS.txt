got all the basics of loading ssm_core_<name>.js modules working in both frontend and backend of client
reworked globals and initialization (formerly bootstrap) to be more 'appropriately positioned'?

at any rate the basics on both front and backend are now all set up to work properly once again!

managed to seperate client and server into 2 diff debuggers so I can launch 
    code code.workspace in the server dir and F5 to run and debug that
    --and seperately launch--
    code code.workspace in the client dir and F5 to run and debug that AT the same time

got the most basic stuff working now
got a simple 'client/jotliner.html' setup and debuggable using vscode
got a simple 'server/jlserver.js' setup (as an express server on 8080) and debuggable using vscode

next step is to move the bulk of the functionality out of 'project.jotliner_02' into this project

Starting project anew (again!)
Concept this time is everything runs in a webpage and it talks to an SQL DB on some backend

Notion here is that html already handles all we desire, we just have to figure out how to make it work for us
