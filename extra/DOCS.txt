to distinguish 'system' keystrokes from handler keystrokes we are using a 'tap-then-hold' approach as follows:

tap  hold then-while-holding   action
ctrl ctrl arrowkeys            move entire box   (tap arrowkeys for 1 pixel or hold for repeat)
ctrl alt  arrowkeys            move contents of box (tap arrowkeys for 1 pixel or hold for repeat)

ctrl ctrl leftmouse+drag       move entire box
ctrl alt  leftmouse+drag       move contents of box

ctrl ctrl rightmouse           program context menu

ctrl ctrl 'u'                  undo last 'system' operation
ctrl ctrl 'r'                  redo last 'system' operation

'system' context menu
create component  -->  while still holding ctrl the entire time, click to start box, drag to size box, let go of ctrl to create component
                       this opens another context menu with a list of all component types that can be created
                       select one or click outside menu to cancel

delete component  -->  delete component (box) under mousecursor at instant of rightmouseDown
                       warns if component has children
                       asks are you sure?

think about undo!
