start with absolutely straight text

we need to record the wordwrap markation
we need to record the 'beginning of every line' markation
    so that when the box is stretched/shrank the entire doc has to be recalculated

I dont really see any good way to handle a text editor without using canvas to prevent differences and quirks in html from boggling the formatting

...but if we're going back to the canvas approach, why don't we just go back to the prior electron code which has already resolved TONS of load/unload issues

The only thing I don't like about the electron approach is the whole debugging issue

Ok so that's what we'll do,  write a 'node server' that spawns a webpage (although for now we'll jsut spawn the webserver manually so we can debug the two halves much better)
